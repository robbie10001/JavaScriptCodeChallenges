## Atomic Blonde

A number is an atomic blonde number if the sum and product of its digits are equal. Write a program to check if a number is an atomic blonde number or not. 

E.g. atomicBlonde(123), should return true (as 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6, as does 1 * 2 * 3)

E.g. atomicBlonde(23), should return false (as 2 + 3 equals 5, whereas  2 * 3 equals 6)
